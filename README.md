A 2-player game of tic tac toe with win, lose, and draw validation

## How It's Made:

I built this project to practice linking JavaScript with HTML and CSS. I wanted to make something that I would be able to build off of for a larger project that I am working on regarding skincare. This design is fully responsive and allowed me to practice skills such as accessibility, refactoring code, fetching data from APIs, etc.

## What I Learned:

I practiced using CSS pseudo classes to style the boxes and learned how to use CSS variables for repetitive style choices. For JavaScript, I practiced constant declaration, global variables, building nested arrays, manipulating the DOM, adding and removing classes from HTML elements, ternary operators, array methods, spreading arrays, and more!
